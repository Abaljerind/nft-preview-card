## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I just noticed that in order to centering the html tag right in the middle of the page browser, i can easily use the height on the body and the container of the element which i want to make it center. And last the property is place-content which is actually new for me and it really help me too, so yeah i think this is actually some of the code I'm proud of.

```html
<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
html,
body {
  ....
  height: 100%;
  margin: 0;
}

section {
  height: 100%;
}

section .card .img-container .img-see-eth {
  ....
  place-content: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this bootstrap and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
